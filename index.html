                <p class="slideLeft">Hello, my name is Andrej Jakimovski. I'm 19 years old, born and raised in Skopje, Macedonia. Currently i'm a student at the Faculty of computer science and engineering. This website is just an example of my life experience and adventures so far. I was born and raised in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia. Growing up in a supportive family, since young age i've always loved playing video games and spending most of my time on computer, so that's how i actually got involved with computer and technology. I have always wondered how people came up with the idea to make the game, the graphics and the design as well as the process of making them.</p>

                <p class="slideLeft">My education started in the primary school Lazo Angelovski which is located in Skopje. I gained my first ever experience for many things, such as meeting new friends. I continued my education at the high school SUGS Vlado Tasevski, also in Skopje. There, i gained more experience with going on a professional practice in Lyon, France for one month. Also i successfully finished both of the educations which helped me to gain experience for the life in future.</p>
