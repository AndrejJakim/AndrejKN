                <h2 class="slideLeft">Vieux Lyon</h2>
                <p class="slideLeft">Stepping into Vieux Lyon, the city's historic district, feels like stepping back in time. The narrow streets, lined with Renaissance-era buildings, exude an old-world charm that captivates the imagination. As I wandered through the traboules, hidden passageways that wind through the buildings, I discovered the secrets of Lyon's past. The impressive Cathédrale Saint-Jean and the Roman amphitheater of Fourvière bear witness to Lyon's ancient roots, while the beautifully preserved traboules offer a glimpse into the city's architectural heritage.</p>
